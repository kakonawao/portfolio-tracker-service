# portfolio-tracker-service

Service to track assets of different types.

## why?

This is a project to track my financial assets I started after testing a few different systems and realising that none 
of them covered my needs, mainly because I have them spread out in different continents and currencies.

## how?

As usual, this will be implemented in a new framework that I discovered recently and looks very promising (FastAPI).
I am also using this chance to test the new github features.
